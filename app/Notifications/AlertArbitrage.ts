/**
 * Fire an alert when a fresh cross-book arbitrage appears.
 *
 * Three destinations, and they answer different questions:
 *
 *   The system row records that the arbitrage existed, which is the
 *   audit trail behind any later claim about what the board showed.
 *
 *   The realtime channel reaches whoever has the page open right now.
 *
 *   The subscriptions reach the people who asked to be told, wherever
 *   they are. That is the one that matters, because the moment an alert
 *   is worth something is the moment nobody is looking at the page.
 *
 * None of them is allowed to fail ingestion — an alert is worth less
 * than the pass that produced it — and none is allowed to fail silently
 * either. Both realtime and notification failures used to be swallowed
 * by a bare catch, so a table that had stopped accepting writes and a
 * broadcast server that was never running produced identical output.
