/**
 * ClosingLine — the final price each book showed before an event started.
 *
 * Frozen once, at kickoff, and never updated. That immutability is the
 * point: the closing line is the market's last and best consensus, and
 * beating it consistently — closing line value — is the strongest known
 * short-horizon evidence that a bettor or model has genuine edge. Win rate
 * over a few hundred bets is mostly noise; CLV converges far faster.
 *
 * Without this table CLV cannot be computed at all, because the price a
 * bet was struck at is only meaningful against the price the market
 * settled on, and the current-price row is overwritten on every tick.
 *
 * `fairProb` stores the de-vigged closing probability, which is the number
 * CLV should actually be measured against — comparing a taken price to a
 * raw closing price silently credits the model with the book's margin.
