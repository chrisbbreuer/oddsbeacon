/**
 * Odd — one bookmaker's *current* price on one selection.
 *
 * Stored as **decimal odds** (e.g. 2.10) so a sportsbook line and a
 * prediction-market share price live in the same unit and compare
 * directly. The join row between {@link Bookmaker} and {@link Selection}.
 *
 * One row per (selection, bookmaker), enforced by a unique index — the
 * ingest upserts against it. Price *history* is append-only in
 * {@link OddsSnapshot}; this table only ever holds the latest.
 *
 * `impliedProb` is denormalized (1/price) so the board can filter and sort
 * on probability without recomputing across every row on every request.
 * Note it still contains the book's margin — the de-vigged number lives on
 * {@link FairPrice}, and the two must not be confused: every honest edge
 * calculation compares a price against the *fair* probability, never
 * against this one.
