/**
 * DecisionEvidence — one measured fact that moved a decision.
 *
 * This is the audit trail behind "AI-driven": each row is a number our
 * own pipeline computed, the query window it came from, and how far it
 * pushed fair value. Read together they reconstruct a decision's
 * arithmetic without re-running anything, which is the difference
 * between a model that can be checked and one that has to be trusted.
 *
 * `kind` names the signal family:
 *   smart_money    — accuracy-weighted flow from traders with a track record
 *   trader_accuracy— the resolved win rate behind that flow
 *   flow_imbalance — notional bought per side over the window
 *   price_trend    — where the venue price has moved recently
 *   liquidity      — depth available, which caps size rather than direction
 *   cross_venue    — the other venue's price on the same question
