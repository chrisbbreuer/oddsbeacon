/**
 * Team fundamentals from ESPN: how each side is doing, and who is out.
 *
 * These endpoints were always available and were never read. The schedule
 * ingest already calls this host and keeps fixtures and scores, and it
 * writes a `record` column that nothing downstream has ever looked at.
 * Everything that prices a market does so from bookmaker quotes alone, so
 * the model has had no way to hold an opinion the books do not already
 * hold.
 *
 * Both passes are additive: a row per team per capture, never an update.
 * A prediction has to stay scoreable against what was knowable when it
 * was made, and an updating row silently rewrites that history.
