/**
 * How lopsided is this fixture, on evidence the bookmaker did not supply?
 *
 * Every other input in this system is derived from book quotes, so the
 * model can only ever restate what the books already think. This is the
 * one read that can contradict them, which makes it the only input
 * capable of finding a genuinely mispriced game rather than a
 * well-priced one with a wide margin.
 *
 * Three sources, in descending order of how much they settle the
 * question:
 *
 *  1. **League tier.** A fourth-division side against a first-division
 *     side is decided before anyone looks at form. It is also the
 *     cheapest field to source and survives a club having no valuation.
 *  2. **Squad value.** Within a tier, money is the best available proxy
 *     for depth, and the ratio matters rather than the difference: a
 *     €900m squad against a €450m one is the same story at any scale.
 *  3. **Record and scoring differential.** Sensitive to form the other
 *     two miss entirely, and the only one available outside soccer.
 *
 * The output is a signed 0..1 strength edge for the home side, and
 * deliberately NOT a probability. Turning it into one requires knowing
 * how much a tier gap is worth in each competition, which is a question
 * only settled results can answer. Until `calibration_buckets` has that
 * history this is an ordering, and the caller decides what to do with it.
