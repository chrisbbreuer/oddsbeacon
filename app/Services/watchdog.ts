 * Noticing when the data stops arriving.

 * Every ingestion pass records what it did, and `/api/v1/status` will
 * report it to anyone who asks — but nothing asked. A provider that
 * stopped matching, a key that expired, a worker that died: all of them
 * look from the outside exactly like a quiet night, and the board keeps
 * serving the last prices it had as though they were current. The product
 * is worth what its data freshness is worth, so a stall has to announce
 * itself rather than wait to be discovered.
 *
 * What counts as overdue depends on the loop. Prices refresh every few
 * minutes and daily fundamentals refresh once a day, so a single
 * threshold would either alert constantly on the slow ones or never on
 * the fast ones.
