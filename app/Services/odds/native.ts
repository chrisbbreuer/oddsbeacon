/**
 * Our own odds feed: every book we have an adapter for, read directly.
 *
 * ### Why the merge happens here
 *
 * Each adapter reports the same game under the book's own event id, so
 * fourteen adapters produce fourteen unrelated {@link FeedEvent}s for one
 * fixture. Something has to decide they are the same game, and it cannot
 * be the adapters — they never see each other's output.
 *
 * It also must not be left to `resolveEvent` downstream. That function
 * links a *provider's* record to one of our events, and it deliberately
 * refuses to merge two records from the same provider: a provider's own
 * ids are authoritative within that provider, so two different ids mean
 * two different games. Every book here arrives under the single provider
 * name `native`, so without merging first, the second book's quote on a
 * game would be refused the link and create a duplicate event instead —
 * one card per book on the board.
 *
 * So this class merges by the same rule `resolveEvent` uses for a *second*
 * provider: the same two teams kicking off within a few hours. That is the
 * strong constraint; the window only has to separate this fixture from the
 * next meeting of the same two clubs.
 *
 * ### Failure is per book, not per pass
 *
 * One book timing out is normal and must not cost the other thirteen.
 * Each adapter's failure is recorded against the run and the pass
 * continues, which is what makes the run status `partial` rather than
 * `failed` — and what stops an on-call alert firing on a transient blip.
 */

/**
 * How far apart two books' kickoff times may be and still be one game.
 *
 * Six hours, matching `resolveEvent`. Providers disagree by minutes,
 * occasionally by an hour when a broadcast slot moves, and teams play the
 * same opponent on consecutive days constantly — a baseball series is
 * three or four straight meetings of the identical pair. Six hours absorbs
 * every real discrepancy while staying far inside the ~18h gap between two
 * games of a series.
