/**
 * The adapter registry.
 *
 * ### One at a time, each against a real payload
 *
 * An adapter has to be written against the book's actual response, and
 * that response can only be obtained by making the request. Writing one
 * from an assumed shape produces a file that looks finished, passes tests
 * against the assumption, and fails on first contact — worse than no
 * adapter, because it claims coverage we do not have.
 *
 * So each adapter lands with a recorded fixture in `tests/fixtures/`, taken
 * from a response the book actually sent, and its test pins the
 * translation against that.
 *
 * The engine handles an empty registry correctly: `refreshSchedule` skips
 * any league no adapter covers, so it schedules nothing and polls nothing
 * rather than looping on an empty fetch.

 * off through `ODDS_BOOKS_DISABLED` without deleting its adapter.
