/**
 * Reconstructing the board as it stood at an instant.
 *
 * `odds_snapshots` is a change log, not a series of board states: a row
 * exists only where a price moved. That is what makes a season of history
 * affordable — snapshotting every poll would add a row per quote per pass,
 * billions a season, while telling us nothing, since the price between two
 * observations is by definition the earlier one.
 *
 * The consequence is that "the board at 14:32" has to be derived: for each
 * selection and book, the latest observation at or before that instant.
 * That is one grouped read rather than a lookup, and it is the reason this
 * lives here rather than being a `SELECT ... WHERE captured_at = ?`.
