/**
 * Rest and congestion, derived from fixtures we already hold.
 *
 * No new source: every input here comes from `market_events.commence_at`
 * and the two team ids already on each row. That is worth stating because
 * it was sitting unused while the model priced games on bookmaker quotes
 * alone, and in the compressed calendars — a back-to-back in the NBA, a
 * third game in five nights in the NHL — the effect is among the largest
 * and best documented in sport.
 *
 * Books price rest, but slowly and unevenly, especially on the second
 * night of a back-to-back for the road side. That lag is the opportunity.
 *
 * Everything is measured strictly before kickoff. A query that counted a
 * team's own result would leak the outcome into a feature meant to
 * predict it, which backtests beautifully and fails live.
