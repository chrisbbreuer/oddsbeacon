 * killed leaves a `running` row behind, which is how a hung provider
 * becomes visible instead of just looking like a quiet period.
 *
 * The counters are the point. `rowsRead` versus `rowsWritten` is the
 * matching yield, and a yield of zero against thousands of rows read is
 * the exact signature of the failure this schema was built to surface —
 * previously that state was indistinguishable from a slow news day.
