/**
 * ESPN as the schedule-and-results backbone.
 *
 * ESPN's site API needs no key, no account, and no quota, which makes it
 * the right source for the two things the system cannot function without:
 * **which games exist** and **how they finished**. Odds feeds are metered
 * and partial; a schedule is neither, and every paid request we spend
 * discovering fixtures is one not spent on prices.
 *
 * It is also what closes the loop that was previously open. Scores were
 * already fetched here for display and then discarded, so nothing was ever
 * graded and no claim about accuracy could be checked. Persisting results
 * is what turns the feature snapshots into a labelled training set instead
 * of a log.
 *
 * The API is undocumented and unstable by nature, so every read is
 * defensive: a shape change degrades to fewer events rather than a thrown
 * pass, and the run row records how many were skipped.
