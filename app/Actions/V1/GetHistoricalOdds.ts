/**
 * GET /api/v1/historical/odds — the board as it stood at a moment.
 *
 * ### Why this is cheap for us and expensive elsewhere
 *
 * A paid feed charges roughly ten times a live call for a historical
 * snapshot, because storing every price at every instant is a genuine cost
 * for a business whose product is the live number.
 *
 * It is close to free here, and not because we are clever: the fair-value
 * model has to know where a line opened and how it moved, so
 * `odds_snapshots` was always going to exist. Serving it is a read against
 * a table we keep for our own sake.
 *
 * ### The snapshot is reconstructed, not stored
 *
 * There is no row saying "the board at 14:32". History is a **change log**
 * — a row exists only where a price moved — so the board at an instant is
 * the latest observation at or before it, per selection and book. That is
 * what makes a season of history affordable, and it is why this endpoint
 * does a `GROUP BY` rather than a lookup.
