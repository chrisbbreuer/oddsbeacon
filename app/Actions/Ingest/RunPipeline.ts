/**
 * The whole data loop, in the one order it can correctly run.
 *
 * Each stage consumes what the previous one produced, and running them out
 * of order does not fail loudly — it produces subtly stale numbers, which
 * is worse. Hence a single entry point rather than several independently
 * scheduled jobs that happen to be sequenced correctly today:
 *
 *  1. **Schedule** — fixtures and results must exist before prices have
 *     anything to attach to, and before anything can be graded.
 *  2. **Odds** — prices, and the history rows movement is derived from.
 *  3. **Fair prices** — de-vig and consensus over the prices just written.
 *  4. **Snapshots** — freeze the feature vector *after* fair values are
 *     current, or the training set records numbers no live caller saw.
 *  5. **Settle** — closing lines, grading, and CLV on anything finished.
 *  6. **Calibration** — rebuild the reliability curves from what settled.
 *  7. **AI** — review the candidates, and score the reviews that resolved.
