/**
 * The single writer for prices, now that it writes in batches.
 *
 * Two properties matter and neither is obvious from reading the code.
 *
 * History is a **change log**: a poll that finds the same price must add
 * nothing. At one pass every five minutes a bug here was a slow leak; at
 * one pass a second it fills the table in an afternoon, and every
 * "the line moved" number computed from it becomes noise.
 *
 * And the batch must survive a provider repeating itself. Two quotes for
 * the same selection and book in one call used to be two sequential
 * writes; in a single multi-row statement it is a duplicate conflict key,
 * which SQLite and Postgres reject outright.
